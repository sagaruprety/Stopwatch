# Stopwatch
This is a simple terminal application implementing the stopwatch functionality which we typically find in our smartphones. Unable to use the smartphone at that instant and the urgent need to use a stopwatch necessitated the writing of this python script. One can use it in absence of a smartphone or a smartwatch, while using the computer. 

This can be used if one has python 2.7 installed. Just fork and clone the repository. Then go inside the cloned directory and type - python stopwatch.py

Follow the instructions which show up after executing the above mentioned command, to use the stopwatch.
